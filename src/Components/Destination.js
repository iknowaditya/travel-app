The magnificent Louvre, exceptional impressionist collections, Centre Pompidou's modern and contemporary art, and a plethora of smaller museums showcasing collections in every imaginable genre. The mesmerizing wrought-iron spire of the Eiffel Tower pierced the skyline, the Arc de Triomphe guarding the most glamorous avenue, the Champs-Élysées, the regal Notre Dame cathedral, lamp-lit bridges spanning the Seine and art nouveau cafes spilling on to wicker-chair-lined terraces.

            text="Yellowstone's Grand Canyon is one of the most iconic sites in the region, providing several stunning vistas as you go along. This almost 40 km long canyon is a large and the most famous canyon in Yellowstone. It is hugely popular among visitors due to its scenic views of the Lower and Upper falls, as well as the fascinating pink and yellow coloured rocks. There are several viewpoints and points of interest along the length of the canyon. The canyon's beautiful shades of colours are an iconic part of Yellowstone. The mineral stains due to the activities of water have given the rocks of the canyon such a pleasant tint of colours, it is truly a sight to behold. The geology of the canyon is not completely clear. It was created due to erosion over hundreds of thousands of years, and the geothermal nature of the area is still prevalent, which can be seen by the hot springs throughout the canyon."

The Maldives is an archipelago of 1,192 coral islands grouped into natural atolls. However, only 200 islands are inhabited. Each resort generally occupies an entire atoll.

Comprising 26 atolls (ring-shaped coral reef that encircles a lagoon), the Maldives is renowned for its incredible diving opportunities, Maldives' azure waters are home to diverse marine life and corals of distinct hues. The capital city of Male is both commercial and financial capital. Seat to the executive, legislature, and judiciary, this city has the most well-connected international airport. The history lovers will be satiated here, given Male houses several buildings and monuments of historical importance. Male is accessible by ferry boats from the international airport. Travel to other islands in the Maldives is also quite feasible from Male due to the excellent ferry and seaplanes connectivity, though it is quite expensive."

            text="Mumbai is a spectacular paradox of chaos and hope, glamor and squalor, modernity and tradition, old and new. Famously known as the City of Dreams, Mumbai ? formerly known as Bombay ? has a long colonial history, starting from Gandhi's visits to the city to the intense protests against the Simon Commission in 1928, the city has stood witness to many important events in the country's freedom struggle. Today, Mumbai is a beautifully blended melting pot of cultures and lifestyles. The city soaks in everything into its fabric, making it its very own. From European and Portuguese inhabitants who migrated years ago to the city, to upcoming actors struggling to make it big on the silver screen; from Bollywood superstars to big industrialists to tribes of fisherman and slum dwellers, Mumbai is a city that proudly boasts of stories from different walks of human survival."

            heading="Pyramids of Giza - Egypt -"
            text="Pyramids of Giza have always been one of the best highlights of the city. The heat and the dust appear to be trivial to explorers when they experience the superb Pyramid of Cheops, which is the biggest pyramid in the Giza collection. Otherwise called the Great Pyramid or the Pyramid of Khufu, it has a plain wonderful tomb chamber with a sarcophagus. The intriguing slender sections inside the Pyramids take you into the Solar Boat gallery showing fabulous Sun-controlled barques revealed in the area that has been carefully re-established to its unique excellence. Towards the south, you would discover the Pyramid of Chephren normally called the Pyramid of Khefre, within which is an enormous passage. Guarding these funeral home sanctuaries is the baffling Sphinx which is line-bodied and faced like a pharaoh and presumably the most praised landmark in Cairo. This fascination is really an antiquated world's prominent milestones."
